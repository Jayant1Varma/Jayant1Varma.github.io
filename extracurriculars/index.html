             <p>Sun song by Brian Lester, played by me back in 2018. This song has a special place in my heart, I loved playing it especially in fingerstyle.
           I almost never recorded my playings so what you're seeing was then perfected, modified and improvised but never recorded. In hindsight, I think
           keeping a log of my growth would've been nice to look back upon, but given how tech-free my life was prior to turning 18, I think 
           it was okay that this thought didn't come to my mind. I was 16 years old back then. 
        
             <br> <br> I'll record and post my 'perfected' music when I get my hands on a guitar for some time XD</p>

        <h2> Tennis videos: </h2>

        <p>My old videos are too old, and suffering from the same problem of living life too much 'tech-free', I never recorded my tennis,
            although we used to record parts of it to find mistakes in my game. I'll upload new recordings when I play next time (soon!).

            The book I read partly with the rest of the reading group, for Club Infinity, the math club at YorkU. <br>
            Don't quiz me too hard on this! I'm still trying to understand much of it and need to read parts of it again although
            I forgot it back home :) <br>
