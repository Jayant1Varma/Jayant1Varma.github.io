            <h3> From clueless beginning to a passionate student: finding myself in computer science</h3>
            <p class="w3-margin-top-2"> 
              I started my BSc Hons in computer science in January 2021. 
              As naiive and clueless as I was about the subject, 
              I knew I was in this for my love for mathematics and building stuff. For 3 online terms, 
              I struggled with little motivation in my cs courses. 
              Although confident with my understanding, I couldn't help but wonder if 
              computer science is my field. <br> <br>

              Just when I was about to change my major to mathematics/ electrical engineering, 
              I learned computer organization and C programming in an in person setting. 
              This kindled a thorough understanding of the machine you're reading this on. 
              This was my turning point. To test my skills on programming (and whether I enjoyed it), 
              I made an artificially intelligent tic tac toe game in C as my first project. 
              I was glued to my laptop, and this project was my baby. The moment my code ran, my passion ignited.
              Inspired by that, I make projects that use whatever I learn from the latest courses I complete, 
            somewhat like a capstone project to scale my capability of the course and giving mere theory practicality. 
            For example, after learning parallel programming in my operating systems class, 
            I made a multi-threaded space invaders game in C, and after software design, 
            I made an artificially intelligent teaching assistant. <br>
                 
            <br>
              Mathematics has been a key driving force for my passion in cs. 
              The idea that we don't need a single test case if we can mathematically prove 
              correctness/ efficiency of an algorithm is simply beautiful. 
              Moved by this, I intend to have a deep understanding of theoretical computer science in my degree,
               while also making projects using popular languages/software as my own projects.
                Therefore, making the most out of my degree in every sense. <br> <br>
              
              Actions speak louder than words; Big success with in-person courses: <br><br>
              
              I knew I had it in me to make a big change. This year, YorkU went completely
               in person, and my GPA boomed with my year average being *over 90% overall* 
               doing 9 courses - 27 credits of which 15 being CS courses. 
               This shot my GPA up to very respectable standards (3.3 out of 4) and 
               eligible for the prestigious Lassonde scholarship. <br>
              
              <br> Conclusion: <br>
              
              From a clueless start, I have now come to the realization that computer science 
              is thought engineering where *we make* our ideas real. Passion can be sparked in 
              various ways, and mine came from theory of computation, computer organization and 
              low level programming. Since then, OOP and programming in general has found a special 
              place in my heart.

              <b>**Professionals kindly note:</b> This website is sort of informal since it goes into links to my instagram,
              what I did for my 21st birthday, my music taste, etc. It's nowhere near vulgar or bad in any sense,
              but its just that these topics are not usually considered 'professional'. This website is meant 
              to show my frontend skills but it's main purpose is for me to express myself to the world. <br> <br>

              I love poetry, 80s rock music in general, and have recently have started liking psychology.

              Here's a link to my playlist showcasing songs of my liking from youtube music, you don't need an account to listen, just enjoy! 
              <a href = https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFldEZ8J9wdC-9GSyBqmNuuN0UkVYU085&feature=share> Rock 'n' Roll! </a> <br>

             
             <br> 
             I play tennis very regularly, love to run, and play table tennis, soccer, badminton, and volleyball. In fact, I used to play competitive tennis at club level and sparr with India's top 100 players. I'll be 
             trying out for York University's varsity team, albeit I'm not sure if I can manage it in my high workload lifestyle. Maybe I will do it
             just because- YOLO!<br>
             I also play the guitar, but have not really played for over 2 years now. I want to learn to play the piano someday, and live
             in a house that has a library like Mr. Higgins', with a grand piano as well ;)

             More than any cars, I want Professor Higgin's grand house and library, look at those books, and proudly say, "I'm so incredibly knowledgable, I've made it, I'm now a true Varma" (I come from a family of freakishly smart people). I realize
             I have to be humble to soak in all the knowledge I can get, afterall, "A wise man can learn more from a foolish question than a fool can learn from a wise answer"(Bruce Lee). I'm confident, to be wise, you need to be humble first, 
             everything else comes after humility and curiosity. For those confused, I'm refering to Mr. Higgins, the character from the play <i>Pygmalion</i> by George Bernard Shaw.
            
             <br><br>
             Look what I did for my 21st Birthday!    <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KErVrkeXzqc">YOLO!!</a> Sneak peak: The clip involves putting myself in danger for adrenaline rush of a lifetime! A major bucket list item was scratched off that day.
