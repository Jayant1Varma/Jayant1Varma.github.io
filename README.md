# Jayant1Varma.github.io
Welcome to my website!

The motivation behind this website is to know me better. I'm more than a resume or a transcript. I'm Jayant. If curious, search up what Jayant means :))

I've always wanted to make my own website, finally my front end skills are coming into real world play! :)

### Link to my website: https://jayant1varma.github.io/

Note: The website is static, but I will add JS code to it sometime later, maybe even use tech like typescript, react.js, etc that I'm learning now in my part time job as a 
backend dev. @YU-Hacks

#### For best experience of my website, kindly grant my website the permission to play audio on your browser:
For Firefox:

For Microsoft Edge:

In the URL, enter: edge://settings/content/mediaAutoplay?search=audio

Then, for the 'allow' sites, add in my website's url. So it eventually should look like:

The website was made fully functioning and I met all my goals for this website on June 4th 2023. The updates in the future are just going to be maintenance.


UPDATE AT 11:34pm, June 4th: I've been granted permission by Brian Crain to use his music for using _Song for Seinna_ as my background.
