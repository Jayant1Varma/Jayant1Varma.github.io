# Jayant1Varma.github.io
Welcome to my website!

The motivation behind this website is to know me better. I'm more than a resume or a transcript. I'm Jayant. If curious, search up what Jayant means :))

I've always wanted to make my own website, finally my front end skills are coming into real world play! :)

### Link to my website: https://jayant1varma.github.io/

Note: The website is static, but I will add JS code to it sometime later, maybe even use tech like typescript, react.js, etc that I'm learning now in my part time job as a 
backend dev. @YU-Hacks
