             <p>Sun song by Brian Lester, played by me back in 2018. This song has a special place in my heart, I loved playing it especially fingerstyle.
           I almost never recorded my playings so what you're seeing was then perfected, modified and improvised but never recorded. In hindsight, I think
           keeping a log of my growth would've been nice to look back upon, but given how tech-free my life was prior to turning 18, I think 
           it was okay that this thought didn't come to my mind. I was 16 years old back then. 
        
             <br> <br> I'll record and post my 'perfected' music when I get my hands on a guitar for some time XD</p>

        <h2> Tennis videos: </h2>

        <p>My old videos are too old, and suffering from the same problem of living life too much 'tech-free', I never recorded my tennis,
            although we used to record parts of it to find mistakes in my game. I'll upload new recordings when I play next time (soon!).

            Work in progress.. stay tuned ... meanwhile you may look at my github, follow links from my resume to know all there is to 
            know about my computer science projects <br> <br>
